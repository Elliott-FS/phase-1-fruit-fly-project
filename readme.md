Hello my name is Elliott Wynn III and this is my phase 1 project from my time at Flatiron School's software engineering bootcamp.

My class was told to design a single page web (SPA) application that fetched data from an external API and handle a few basic event types: click, submit, and mousover.

The application is called fruit fly, it allows the user to view nutritional data on a rotating menu of fruits.
Click on a picture of each fruit to view data.
Mouse over the the image at the bottom to change the ad displayed.
There is also a form where you can add a comment(note comments were not required to persist).

This project was made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

To view this project intsall a json server with this command: npm install -g json-server
then set server to tun and watch the data base: json server --watch db.json
open the index.html in the browser to view the application. 

Thank you for taking interest in this project for more projects please check out my github page: https://github.com/Elliott-FS
